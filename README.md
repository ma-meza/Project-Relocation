# Project Relocation
Final CEGEP Group Project

This is a rocket game developed in Java and JavaFX. This project was built for our final CEGEP programming class project.

To play the game, just import everything into your IDE and run it. Simple as that.

To complete the game, you will have to control several types of rockets throughout 18 levels by dragging and dropping a set of command blocks onto a timeline.
Collect all the stars to buy rocket upgrades.
Hope you have fun!
