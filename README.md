# ProjectRelocation
Final CEGEP Programming Course Project

Just a small rocket game programmed in Java and JavaFX. This project was accomplished in the last CEGEP semester for the Programming class.

To play the game, just import everything into your IDE and run it, simple as that.

In order to complete the 18 levels, you will have to control the rockets with a set of command blocks that you will drag and drop in a timeline.
Collect all the stars to buy rocket upgrades.
Hope you have fun!
